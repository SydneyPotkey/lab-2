# Instructions

**Create a Quarto file for ALL Lab 2 (no separate files for Parts 1 and 2).**

- Make sure your final file is carefully formatted, so that each analysis is
clear and concise.
- Be sure your knitted `.html` file shows **all** your source code, including
any function definitions. 

# Part One: Identifying Bad Visualizations

If you happen to be bored and looking for a sensible chuckle, you should check
out these [Bad Visualisations](https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/). Looking through these is also a good exercise in cataloging what makes a visualization
good or bad. 

## Dissecting a Bad Visualization

Below is an example of a less-than-ideal visualization from the collection
linked above. It comes to us from data provided for the [Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report](https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) by the 
Gallup World Poll:

![](images/bad-wellcome-graph.jpg)

1. While there are certainly issues with this image, do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

This graph is attempting to compare the percent of people who believe vaccines are safe in various countries grouped by region. I think that the authors meant to convey the apprehension certain countries have pertaining to vaccines. 


2. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization. 
*Hint: Variables refer to columns in the data.*

The variables evident in this graph are region (Americas, Asia, etc.), and percent of population who believe vaccines are safe.


3. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (e.g., `ggplot`), list the *aesthetics* used and which *variables* are mapped to each.

It seems like the graph only uses an x axis variable, percent of population who believes vaccines are safe, and a grouping variable, region. The graph does not contai a y axis variable even though points are plotted at different heights. 

4. What type of graph would you call this? Meaning, what `geom` would you use
to produce this plot?

I would say this is a geom point.


5. Provide at least four problems or changes that would improve this graph. 
*Please format your changes as bullet points!*

* apply a relevant y axis variable or change the style of plot 
* connect the grid lines 
* move the region labels to somewhere where they are not crowding 
* add an x-axis label that tells the reader the numeric values are percents or add percent signs


## Improving the Bad Visualization

The data for the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report can be downloaded at the following site: [https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018](https://wellcome.org/sites/default/files/wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx)

<!-- at the "Dataset and crosstabs for all countries" link on the right side of the page-->

There are two worksheets in the downloaded dataset file. You may need to read
them in separately, but you may also just use one if it suffices.

# Visualization 1

```{r}
#| label: read-in-wellcome-data
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
world_data <- read_excel("/Users/sydneypotkey/Desktop/wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx", sheet = 1)
world_data_full <- read_excel("/Users/sydneypotkey/Desktop/wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx", sheet = 2)
world_data <- read_excel("/Users/sydneypotkey/Desktop/wgm2018-dataset-crosstabs-all-countries.xlsx", sheet = 3)
head(df)

```
## Filtering the Data
```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

data_dictionary <- world_data |>
  filter(`Variable Name` == "WP5") |>
  mutate(code_list = str_split(`Variable Type & Codes*`, ",")) |>
  select(code_list) |>                      
  unnest(code_list) |>                       
  mutate(code_list = str_trim(code_list)) |> 
  separate(code_list, into = c("WP5", "country"), sep = "=") |>
  mutate(WP5 = as.character(WP5))


world_data_full <- world_data_full |> 
  mutate(WP5 = as.character(WP5))

  

joined_data <- inner_join(world_data_full, data_dictionary, by = "WP5" )

joined <- joined_data |>
  select(country, Q25, Regions_Report)

graph_data <- joined |> 
  mutate(region = case_when(Regions_Report %in% c(9, 10, 11, 12)~"Asia", Regions_Report %in% c(1, 2, 4, 5)~"Sub-Saharan Africa", Regions_Report %in% c(6, 7, 8)~"Americas", Regions_Report %in% c(14, 15, 16, 17)~"Europe", Regions_Report == 18~"Australia & NZ", Regions_Report %in% c(3, 13)~"North Africa & Middle East")) |>
  filter(!is.na(region)) |>
  group_by(country, region) |> 
  summarise(total_respondents = n(),
    agree = sum(Q25 == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    percent_agree = 100 * agree / total_respondents
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(percent_agree)) 
  

  

```
6. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you
identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the
same story better.

```{r}
#| label: new-and-improved-visualization
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(scales)
library(ggiraph)

cbp2 <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
          "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

  

plot <- ggplot(data = graph_data, aes(y = percent_agree/100, x = country, color = region, tooltip = country, data_id = country)) +
  geom_point_interactive(size = 2) + 
  facet_grid(~region, labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 15)) +
  labs(x = "", subtitle  = "Percent Who Believe Vaccines Are Safe", title = "Percent of Population That Believe Vaccinces Are Safe by Region", y = "") + 
  theme_light()+ 
  scale_color_manual(values = cbp2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none", 
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) 

    
  
  geom_point_interactive(aes(x = wt, y = qsec, color = disp,
    tooltip = carname, data_id = carname))
  
  girafe(ggobj = plot)
  
  
 

```

# Part Two: Broad Visualization Improvement

The full Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report can be found here: [https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-global-monitor-2018.pdf](https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-global-monitor-2018.pdf). 
Surprisingly, the visualization above does not appear in the report despite the
citation in the bottom corner of the image!

# Visualization 2

**For this second plot, you must select a plot that uses maps so you can demonstrate your proficiency with the `leaflet` package!**

7. Select a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. 
Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

I chose the chloropleth graph from the first page titled Hindi belt scores low while south does better". This graph shows the female labor percentage in Indian states. They are trying to highlight stark differences in labor percentage based on the different states. 

8. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.

State and female labor percent

9. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the
aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.

This graph does not use gg plot.

10. What type of graph would you call this?

Chloropleth 

11. List all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph. 

The main problem is the legend. The scale used for the legen is not standard and does not make sense. It could also be misleading since each color gradient represents a different amount of change. ex. the first shade represents 4.1-15.4, a change of about 11 percentage point, but the second shade represents 15.5-19.9, only about 4 percentage points.

12. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.

  addLegend(pal = pal,
    values = ~Female.LFPR....,
    title = "Female Labor Force Participation (%)",
    position = "bottomright" ) 
  
  





 
```

# Visualization 3

**For this third plot, you must use one of the other `ggplot2` extension packages mentioned this week (e.g., `gganimate`, `plotly`, `patchwork`, `cowplot`).**
 
13. Select a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. 
Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the
story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do
you think the authors meant to convey with it?

I used the visualization titled "Average Female height per Country. This graph shows the differences in height for multiple countries across different continents. It uses female figures to display that these are the heights of female residents specifically. 

14. List the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.

Country and height

15. Now that you're versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the
aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.

The aesthetics of this graph are y = height, fill = country, x = country

16. What type of graph would you call this?

A bar chart

17. List all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph.  

This graph is very misleading since it uses figures as the bars i the bar chart. The figures are scaled so instead of just showing differences in height they shrink completely. Also the title could be improved and the y axis needs to begin at 0. 


18. Improve the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.

```{r}
#| label: third-improved-visualization
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(cowplot)

df <- data.frame(country = c("Latvia", "Australia", "Scotland", "Peru", "South Africa", "India"), Height = c(65, 64, 64, 64, 62, 60))

pink_palette <- c("#FEC5E5", "#F79AC0", "#FD5DA8", "#FF1480", "#F25278", "#DB7093")

feet <- function(x) {
  feet <- floor(x / 12)
  inches <- round(x %% 12)
  paste0(feet, "'", inches, "\"")
}



ggplot(data = df, aes( x = country, y = Height, fill = country)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pink_palette) + 
  theme_minimal_vgrid() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = feet)  +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + 
  labs(x = "", y = "Height (Feet)", title = "Average Female Height by Country") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = feet(Height)), hjust = 1.5, size = 4, color = "white")




```
